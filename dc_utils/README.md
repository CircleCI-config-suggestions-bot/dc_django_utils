# DC utils is the replacement for the DC base theme.

The scope of this repo is "anything that all DC projects might use". It doesn't contain styles (that's the design system's job), but it will contain helpers for outputting HTML in the way the design system wants (e.g, form helpers). 

TO DO: Other common utils  
common testing helpers
view mixins
running some smoke tests on CI
